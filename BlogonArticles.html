    <p class="lead text-left">The cost of computation (Source: <a href="http://www.santafe.edu/" target="_blank">Santa
        Fe Institute</a>)</p>
    <p class="text-left">For decades, physicists have wrestled with understanding the thermodynamic cost of manipulating
        information, what we would now call computing. How much energy does it take, for example, to erase a single bit
        from a computer? What about more complicated operations? These are pressing, practical questions, as artificial
        computers are energy hogs, claiming an estimated four percent of total energy consumed in the United States.<br>
        These questions are not limited to the digital machines constructed by us. The human brain can be seen as a
        computer -- one that gobbles an estimated 10 to 20 percent of all the calories a person consumes. Living cells,
        too, can be viewed as computers, but computers that "are many orders of magnitude more efficient" than any
        laptop or smartphone humans have constructed, says David Wolpert of the Santa Fe Institute.<br>
        Wolpert, a mathematician, physicist, and computer scientist, has been on the frontlines of a rapid resurgence of
        interest in a deep understanding of the energy cost of computing. That research is now hitting its stride,
        thanks to advances in using some revolutionary tools recently developed in statistical physics, in order to
        understand the thermodynamic behavior of nonequilibrium systems. The reason these tools are so important is that
        computers are decidedly nonequilibrium systems. (Unplug your laptop and wait for it to reach equilibrium, and
        then see if it still works.) Although Wolpert primarily approaches these issues using tools from computer
        science and physics, there is also sharp interest from researchers in other areas, including those who study
        chemical reactions, cellular biology, and neurobiology.<br>
        However, research in nonequilibrium statistical physics largely happens in silos, says Wolpert. In a review
        published today in the Journal of Physics A, Wolpert collects recent advances in understanding the
        thermodynamics of computation that are grounded in computer science and physics. The review functions as a sort
        of state-of-the-science report for a burgeoning interdisciplinary investigation.<br>
        "It is basically a snapshot of the current state of the fields, where these ideas are starting to explode, in
        all directions," says Wolpert.<br>
        In the paper, Wolpert first summarizes the relevant theoretical ideas from physics and computer science. He then
        discusses what's known about the entropic cost of a range of computations, from erasing a single bit to running
        a Turing machine. He goes on to show how breakthroughs in nonequilibrium statistical physics have enabled
        researchers to more formally probe those cases -- moving far beyond simple bit erasure.<br>
        Wolpert also touches on the questions raised in this recent research which suggest real-world challenges, like
        how to design algorithms with energy conservation in mind. Can biological systems, for example, serve as
        inspiration for designing computers with minimal thermodynamic cost?<br>
        "We are being surprised and astonished in many ways," Wolpert says. In putting together the review, and
        coediting a book on the topic due out later this year, "we've uncovered phenomena that no one has analyzed
        before that were very natural to us, as we pursue this modern version of the thermodynamics of computation."

    <p class="lead text-left">Why Artificial Intelligence Isn't a Sure Thing to <a
            href="https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/artificial-intelligence-tools-won-t-automatically-increase-productivity">Increase
        Productivity</a></p>
    <p class="text-left">
        Thinking about the fast-approaching era of artificial intelligence, employers rejoice in the increases to
        productivity such tools could bring, while workers are more likely to calculate the time left before R2-D2 takes
        over their jobs.<br>
        “Jacques Bughin and co-researchers estimate that in the future, 50 percent of all tasks currently done by humans
        could be done by machine learning and artificial intelligence,” says Prithwiraj (Raj) Choudhury, assistant
        professor at Harvard Business School. Overall, that could translate into a bump in global productivity by 1
        percent or more.<br>
        But it turns out that long before robots replace workers en masse, if ever, workers will be using AI-based tools
        to do work, as is already seen with radiologists who employ such tools to interpret X-rays and lawyers who turn
        to machine learning to dig out past cases that set a precedent for legal arguments.<br>
        <mark>“IF SOMEONE’S PAST EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN ENTIRELY IN THE WORLD OF OLDER TECHNOLOGY, AND SUDDENLY A MACHINE
        LEARNING TOOL IS THRUST UPON THEM, THEY WILL BE LESS PRODUCTIVE”</mark><br>
        Choudhury realized there was scant research available on the skills needed by workers to use artificial
        intelligence-based tools to their full promise. And that’s a key piece of information to have as companies
        consider investing what consulting firm Accenture estimates will be $35 trillion into cognitive technologies in
        the United States by 2035. Just adding AI tools does not automatically increase productivity if the people using
        them can’t use the technology correctly.<br>
        “AI tools might be good at predictions, but, if they are not used properly, there is no value in investing in
        such tools,” Choudhury says.<br>
        Choudhury aims to fill that gap with a new working paper, Different Strokes for Different Folks: Experimental
        Evidence on Complementarities Between Human Capital and Machine Learning. The paper, written with Evan Starr and
        Rajshree Agarwal of the University of Maryland, suggests that firms must think carefully about the skills
        they’ll need to hire for or train for in employees if they are going to get the most bang for the buck from
        their new AI.<br>
        Choudhury has spent his career researching human capital, looking inside companies such as Microsoft, Infosys,
        and McKinsey to analyze what makes knowledge workers most productive. A few years ago, he began looking at the
        United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), which has used innovative practices around employees working
        remotely.<br>
        “I found the US patent office fascinating,” Choudhury says. “It is not only a large organization with more than
        10,000 people, but also an organization that shapes the innovation system. What they do matters for the entire
        US economy.”<br>
        In the course of writing a Harvard Business School case on the patent office, he discovered the agency was
        implementing a sophisticated new machine learning program called Sigma-AI in an attempt to cut the time
        necessary to review patent applications.<br>
        Patent examiners can use Sigma-AI to make sure applications propose truly novel ideas, and not designs or
        techniques previously used in other patents—known as prior art. “That means searching through hundreds of
        thousands of documents,” says Choudhury.<br>
        The office aims to provide at least an initial answer to applicants within 10 months. With an increase in patent
        application by nearly 20 percent in five years, however, there is currently a backlog of a half-million
        applications, resulting in delays of an additional six months or more.<br>
        In the past, employees have used a Google-like Boolean search tool in order to identify prior art, hunting for
        specific keywords to pull up past cases. The new machine learning tool automates this process, Choudhury says.
        “The document is fed into this tool, and then it spits out what it thinks would be the relevant documents for an
        examiner to look at.”
